# 🧠 Handwritten Digit & Character Recognition (MNIST + EMNIST)

A deep learning project using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify handwritten digits and characters from two benchmark datasets:  
- **MNIST (Digits 0–9)**  
- **EMNIST Balanced (Extended MNIST with letters & digits)**  

---

## ✨ Highlights
- 🔥 Achieves **99% accuracy on MNIST**  
- 🔡 Achieves **~89% accuracy on EMNIST Balanced**  
- ⚡ Implemented with **TensorFlow/Keras** in Google Colab  
- 🛠️ Includes **data preprocessing, training, evaluation & visualization**  
- 🎯 Uses **Batch Normalization, Dropout & Early Stopping** for better generalization
